How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Manual commands is helpful using small lines of code. 
	Using FC command in Windows helped me to view the difference alot quicker than the manual

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In Google docs, file is automatically saved, we can retrieve from the same file only for a particular time.
	In Git, we save data from the start and can retrieve them.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git has repository where it can store various commits unlike Google Docs each need to treat separately

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used for viewing all the commits made in it. 
	git diff allows you to differentiate the lines of code which were changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It helps you to find bug in the program.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    helps to solve the debug.
